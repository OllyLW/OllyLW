### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oliver and I am currently undertaking a Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering. 

I qualified with an undergraduate degree in Law and, having worked in the sector post graduation, have decided to change career path into the world of tech!

I have always been passionate about technology and the advancements which are constantly taking place so I am very excited to embark upon a career in the tech sector.
